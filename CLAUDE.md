# HyperFrames Composition Project

## Read first, every video task

**Founding doc:** [`docs/skills/how-a-video-gets-made.md`](docs/skills/how-a-video-gets-made.md)

This is the canonical 10-stage flow from a brand URL to a finished MP4. The doc itself is slim — it links out to companion docs at each stage. **Read it first.** Don't skip stages, don't substitute it with older process docs (they're in `docs/_archive/` and are superseded).

The most important stage is **Stage 3 (Copywriting)** — Jobs A/B/C/D + 6-question rubric + A/B inner loop + scrape-first rule. Skipping Stage 3 is the recurring failure mode.

## Where things live

**Project layout:** [`STRUCTURE.md`](STRUCTURE.md) — the predictable file/folder pattern. If you can't find something, check this. If you create something new, put it where the pattern says (per-brand stuff → `videos/<brand>/`; shared stuff → `assets/`, `design/`, `compositions/templates/`).

## Skills — USE THESE FIRST

**Always invoke the relevant skill before writing or modifying compositions.** Skills encode framework-specific patterns (e.g., `window.__timelines` registration, `data-*` attribute semantics, shader-compatible CSS rules) that are NOT in generic web docs. Skipping them produces broken compositions.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **hyperframes**            | `/hyperframes`            | Creating or editing HTML compositions, captions, TTS, audio-reactive animation, marker highlights |

## Commands

```bash
npx hyperframes preview          # preview in browser (studio editor)
npx hyperframes render       # render to MP4
npx hyperframes lint         # validate compositions (errors + warnings)
npx hyperframes lint --verbose  # include info-level findings
npx hyperframes lint --json     # machine-readable output for CI
npx hyperframes docs <topic> # reference docs in terminal
```

## Documentation

**For quick reference**, use the local CLI docs command (no network required):

```bash
npx hyperframes docs <topic>
```

Topics: `data-attributes`, `gsap`, `compositions`, `rendering`, `examples`, `troubleshooting`

**For full documentation**, discover pages via the machine-readable index — do NOT guess URLs:

```
https://hyperframes.heygen.com/llms.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — main composition (root timeline)
- `compositions/` — sub-compositions referenced via `data-composition-src`
- `meta.json` — project metadata (id, name)
- `transcript.json` — whisper word-level transcript (if generated)

## Linting — ALWAYS RUN AFTER CHANGES

After creating or editing any `.html` composition, **always** run the linter before considering the task complete:

```bash
npx hyperframes lint
```

Fix all errors before presenting the result. Warnings are informational and usually safe to ignore.

## Key Rules

1. Every timed element needs `data-start`, `data-duration`, and `data-track-index`
2. Elements with timing **MUST** have `class="clip"` — the framework uses this for visibility control
3. Timelines must be paused and registered on `window.__timelines`:
   ```js
   window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
   window.__timelines["composition-id"] = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
   ```
4. Videos use `muted` with a separate `<audio>` element for the audio track
5. Sub-compositions use `data-composition-src="compositions/file.html"` to reference other HTML files
6. Only deterministic logic — no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`, no network fetches
